# __Object Detection Getting Started__

This project provides an STM32 microcontroller embedded real-time environment to execute  [STEdgeAI](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stedgeai-core.html) generated models targeting object detection application. The code developement is lead by its understandability rather than its performance, and is intended to be used as a starting point for further development.

This is a standalone project that can be used as-is to deploy the application on the hardware. However, it is also part of the [ST ModelZoo repo](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/stm32ai-modelzoo-services) and is needed to deploy the object detection use case. The ModelZoo allows you to train, evaluate and deploy automatically any supported model. If you wish to use it as part of the ModelZoo, please refer to the [ModelZoo README](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/stm32ai-modelzoo-services/blob/main/application_code/object_detection/STM32N6/README.md) on how to use it.

This top readme gives an overview of the app. Additional documentation is available in the [Doc](./Doc/) folder.

## Hardware Support

The development platform:
- [STM32N6570-DK](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32n6570-dk.html) discovery board
  - The board should be connected to the onboard ST-LINK debug adapter CN6 with a __USB-C to USB-C cable to ensure sufficient power__
  - __Set the boot mode in dev mode__ (BOOT1 switch to right position. BOOT0 switch position doesn't matter)
  - OTP fuses are set in this example for xSPI IOs in order to get the maximum speed (200MHz) on xSPI interfaces

And one of the following camera modules:
- Provided IMX335 camera module 
- [STEVAL-55G1MBI](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/steval-55g1mbi.html)
- [STEVAL-66GYMAI1](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/steval-66gymai.html)

![Board](_htmresc/ImageBoard.JPG)
STM32N6570-DK board with MB1854B IMX335.

## Tools version

- [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/development-tools/software-development-tools/stm32-software-development-tools/stm32-ides/stm32cubeide.html) (__STM32CubeIDE 1.17.0__)
- [STM32CubeProgrammer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html) (__v2.18.0__)
- [STEdgeAI](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stedgeai-core.html) (__v2.0.0__)

## Boot modes

The STM32N6 does not have any internal flash. To retain your firmware after a reboot, you must program it in the external flash. Alternatively, you can load your firmware directly from SRAM (dev mode). However, in dev mode if you turn off the board, your program will be lost.

__Boot modes:__

- Dev mode (boot switch to the right): load firmware from debug session in RAM, program firmware in external flash
- Boot from flash (boot switch to the left): boot from firmware in external flash

## Quickstart using prebuilt binaries

Three binaries must be programmed in the board external flash using the following procedure:

  1. Switch BOOT1 switch to right position
  2. Program `Binary/ai_fsbl.hex` (First stage boot loader)
  3. Program `Binary/network_data.hex` (params of the networks; To be changed only when the network is changed)
  4. Program `Binary/STM32N6_GettingStarted_ObjectDetection.hex` (firmware application)
  5. Switch BOOT1 switch to Left position
  6. Power cycle the board

__Note__: The `Binary/STM32N6_GettingStarted_ObjectDetection.hex` firmware is built for MB1939 STM32N6570-DK REV C02 with IMX335 Camera module.
__Note__: The `Binary/ai_fsbl.hex` firmware is built for MB1939 STM32N6570-DK REV C02.

### How to Program hex files using STM32CubeProgrammer UI

See [How to Program hex files STM32CubeProgrammer](Doc/Program-Hex-Files-STM32CubeProgrammer.md)

### How to Program hex files using Command line

Make sure to have the STM32CubeProgrammer bin folder added in your path.

```bash
export DKEL="<STM32CubeProgrammer_N6 Install Folder>/bin/ExternalLoader/MX66UW1G45G_STM32N6570-DK.stldr"

# First Stage Boot loader
STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=SWD mode=HOTPLUG -el $DKEL -hardRst -w Binary/ai_fsbl.hex

# Network parameters and biases
STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=SWD mode=HOTPLUG -el $DKEL -hardRst -w Binary/network_data.hex

# Application Firmware
STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=SWD mode=HOTPLUG -el $DKEL -hardRst -w Binary/STM32N6_GettingStarted_ObjectDetection.hex
```

## Quickstart using source code

Before building and running the application you have to program `network_data.hex` (model weights and biases).
This step only has to be done once unless you change AI model.
See [Quickstart using prebuilt binaries](#quickstart-using-prebuilt-binaries) for details.

More information about boot modes is available at [Boot Overview](Doc/Boot-Overview.md)

### Application build and run - Dev mode

__Make sure to have the switch to the right side.__

#### STM32CubeIDE

Double click on `STM32CubeIDE/.project` to open project in STM32CubeIDE. Build and run.

#### Makefile

Before running commands below be sure to have them in your PATH.

1. Build project using the provided `Makefile`:

```bash
make -j8
```

2. Open a gdb server connected to the STM32 target:

```bash
ST-LINK_gdbserver -p 61234 -l 1 -d -s -cp <path-to-stm32cubeprogramer-bin-dir> -m 1 -g
```

3. In a separate terminal session launch a GDB session to load the firmware image into the device memory:

```bash
$ arm-none-eabi-gdb build/Project.elf
(gdb) target remote :61234
(gdb) monitor reset
(gdb) load
(gdb) continue
```

### Application build and run - Boot from flash

__Make sure to have the switch to the right side.__

#### Build the application

##### STM32CubeIDE

Double click on `STM32CubeIDE/.project` to open project in STM32CubeIDE. Build and run.

##### Makefile

Before running commands below be sure to have commands in your PATH.

Build project using the provided `Makefile`:

```bash
make -j8
```

#### Program the firmware in the external flash

Once your app is built with Makefile, STM32CubeIDE, you can add a signature to the bin file:
```bash
STM32_SigningTool_CLI -bin build/Project.bin -nk -t ssbl -hv 2.3 -o build/Project_sign.bin
```

You can program the signed bin file at the address `0x70100000`.
```bash
export DKEL="<STM32CubeProgrammer_N6 Install Folder>/bin/ExternalLoader/MX66UW1G45G_STM32N6570-DK.stldr"

# Adapt build path to your IDE
STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=SWD mode=HOTPLUG -el $DKEL -hardRst -w build/Project_sign.bin 0x70100000
```

__Note__: Only the App binary needs to be programmed if the fsbl and network_data.hex was previously programmed.

__Put the switch to the left side.__

Do a power cycle to boot from the external flash.

## Known Issues and Limitations

- Only RGB888 format for nn input has been tested.
- Only UINT8 format for nn input is supported.
- ASPECT_RATIO_FULLSCREEN does not work as expected
