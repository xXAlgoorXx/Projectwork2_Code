writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
damages.

Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or
rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You
may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of
any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,

INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS, WHETHER FORESEEABLE OR UNFORESEEABLE AND WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DAMAGES
ARE BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION
WITH THIS LLA – EVEN IF LICENSEE HAS BEEN ADVISED, OR IS AWARE, OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
ST AND ITS AFFILIATES AGGREGATE AND CUMULATIVE LIABILITY TOWARDS LICENSEE UNDER THIS LLA SHALL NOT
EXCEED 100 USD (ONE HUNDRED US DOLLARS). THE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE IN THIS ARTICLE 7 SHALL
ONLY APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
8. TERM AND TERMINATION
This LLA shall be valid for a period that starts upon Your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this LLA and ends upon the
earlier of two (2) years or ST’s making the Licensed Materials or a subsequent version of the Licensed Materials available for
download via www.st.com. Licensee may terminate this LLA at any time by destroying all Licensed Materials and other
Confidential Information or by returning those to ST. ST may terminate this LLA at any time if (i) You fail to comply with the terms
and conditions of this LLA, (ii) You threaten or file litigation against ST or its Affiliates, (iii) ST or its Affiliates receive notice of any
claim, suit or proceeding that alleges that the Licensed Materials or Your use of the Licensed Materials infringes any third-party

appointed over Licensee, or any assignment is made for the benefit of creditors of Licensee.
Upon termination or expiration, You shall delete, destroy, or return to ST all Licensed Materials in Your possession and You shall

Articles 2 to 10, inclusive, shall survive the termination or expiration of this LLA.
9. MISCELLANEOUS
If a court or agency of competent jurisdiction holds any term of this LLA invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, the
remainder of this LLA shall be valid and enforceable and You and ST shall discuss in good faith a substitute, valid, enforceable
provision which most nearly effects the parties intent in entering into this LLA.
The delay or failure by ST to enforce any provisions of this LLA or to exercise any right in respect thereto shall not be construed
as constituting a waiver of any right of ST or obligation of Licensee.
No agency, joint venture, partnership or other business organization shall be created or be construed as being created by
reason of this LLA. You will not have the right or authority to, and shall not, assume or create any obligation of any nature
whatsoever on behalf of ST and its Affiliates or bind ST and its Affiliates in any respect whatsoever. You and ST are independent
parties. Nothing in this LLA shall be construed as making You an employee, agent or legal representative of ST.

representations, undertakings and agreements previously made between You and ST and/or its Affiliates and shall prevail over
the terms and conditions set forth in any document from You with respect to the subject matter of this LLA. Any amendment to
this LLA shall be agreed in writing and be duly signed by You and ST and shall make clear reference to this LLA.
Licensee agrees that ST’s Affiliates are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this LLA.
Licensee agrees that in the event of any breach of this LLA by Licensee or its contractors, the resulting harm to ST and its
Affiliates would likely be of a nature that monetary damages would not provide an adequate remedy, and therefore, ST and its
Affiliates shall be entitled to seek specific performance, injunction, and other equitable relief.
10. APPLICABLE LAW
This LLA is governed by the laws of Switzerland, without regard to its conflict of law rules. All disputes or questions arising out of
or in connection with this LLA shall be finally settled by the competent courts of Geneva, Switzerland. Licensee hereby waives
any objection to venue. Notwithstanding the aforesaid, nothing in this LLA shall prevent ST from seeking any interim or final
injunctive or equitable relief by a court of competent jurisdiction.

companies (including prospectively) any competitive use, access, and
benchmarking test restrictions in the terms governing your software to the
extent your terms of use are, or purport to be, more restrictive than

terms governing your software, you are not allowed to access or use this
software, and will not do so. 

2. DISTRIBUTION AND PRODUCTION USE. If you have obtained and/or are developing on
microprocessor(s) and/or microcontroller(s) (“hardware”) listed in the file
named “LICENSED-HARDWARE.txt” included in the repository and/or distributed with
the software you have the following rights in and to the software solely when

the LICENSED-HARDWARE.txt file, you do not have the rights in this Section 2. 

a) Distribution and Production Use Rights.  

i. You may use the software in production (e.g. program the modified or unmodified
software to devices you own or control) and distribute (i.e. make available to
third parties) the modified or unmodified binary image produced from this code.

ii. You may permit your device distributors or developers to copy and distribute the
binary image as programmed or to be programmed to your devices. 

iii. You may redistribute the unmodified or modified source to your device
distributors or developers. Modifications must be clearly marked. Any

devices, include with such distribution the terms of this agreement; and 
iii. indemnify, defend and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims, including claims arising from any High Risk Uses, and inclusive of attorneys’ fees, related to the distribution or use of your devices that include the software, except to the extent that any intellectual property claim is based solely on the unmodified software.

c) Restrictions. You may not: 
i. use or modify the software to create competing real time operating system
software;  

ii. remove any copyright notices or licenses contained in the software; 

iii. use Microsoft’s trademarks or trade dress in your application in any way that

v. use or distribute the software in any way that would subject the software or
Microsoft’s intellectual property or technology to any other license terms. 

3. SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. Microsoft reserves all
other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this
limitation, you will not (and have no right to):

that is transmitted to Microsoft. To learn more about how Microsoft processes
personal data we collect, please see the Microsoft Privacy Statement at
https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=248681. 

5. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. You must comply with all domestic and international export
laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include restrictions on
destinations, end users, and end use. For further information on export
restrictions, visit https://aka.ms/exporting.

faults”, and without warranty of any kind. 

7. UPDATES. Microsoft may periodically update the software. You may obtain updates
only from Microsoft or Microsoft-authorized sources. Updates may not include or
support all existing software features, services, or peripheral devices. 

8. TERMINATION. Without prejudice to any other rights, Microsoft may terminate this
agreement if you fail to comply with any of its terms or conditions. In such
event, you must destroy all copies of the software and all of its component
parts. 

9. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and any other terms Microsoft may provide for
supplements, updates, or third-party applications, is the entire agreement for
the software. To the extent you have entered into a separate agreement with
Microsoft relating specifically to the software, the terms in such agreement
shall control. 

10. APPLICABLE LAW AND PLACE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES. If you acquired the software in
the United States or Canada, the laws of the state or province where you live
(or, if a business, where your principal place of business is located) govern
the interpretation of this agreement, claims for its breach, and all other
claims (including consumer protection, unfair competition, and tort claims),
regardless of conflict of laws principles. If you acquired the software in any
other country, its laws apply. If U.S. federal jurisdiction exists, you and
Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal court in
King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court. If not, you and
Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the Superior Court of
King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court. 

11. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain legal
rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of
your state or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft,
you may also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the
software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your
state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the
software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the
following provisions apply to you: 

a) Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and
nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights. 

b) Germany and Austria. 

i. Warranty. The properly licensed software will perform substantially as
described in any Microsoft materials that accompany the software. However,
Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the licensed software. 

ii. Limitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence,
claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as, in case of death or
personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable according to the statutory law.


Subject to the foregoing clause ii., Microsoft will only be liable for slight
negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations,
the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the
breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance
with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called "cardinal obligations").
In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight
negligence. 
12. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. 
a) THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK OF
USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS. TO
THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES ALL IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND
NON-INFRINGEMENT. 
b) HIGH RISK USE DISCLAIMER. WARNING: THE SOFTWARE IS NOT DESIGNED OR INTENDED FOR USE  WHERE FAILURE OR FAULT OF ANY KIND OF THE SOFTWARE COULD  RESULT IN DEATH OR SERIOUS BODILY INJURY, OR IN  PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE (“collectively High Risk Use”). Accordingly, You must design and implement your hardware and software such that, in the event of any interruption, defect, error, or other failure of the software, the safety of people, property, and the environment are not reduced below a level that is reasonable, appropriate, and legal, whether in general or for a specific industry. Your High Risk Use of the software is at Your own risk. 

13. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. IF YOU HAVE ANY BASIS FOR RECOVERING
DAMAGES DESPITE THE PRECEDING DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY, YOU CAN RECOVER FROM
MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT
RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL,
INDIRECT, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES. 

This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services,
content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party
applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, warranty, guarantee, or
condition; strict liability, negligence, or other tort; or any other claim; in
each case to the extent permitted by applicable law. 

It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the
possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to
you because your state, province, or country may not allow the exclusion or
limitation of incidental, consequential, or other damages. 

 Please note: As this software is distributed in Canada, some of the clauses in
this agreement are provided below in French. 

Remarque: Ce logiciel étant distribué au Canada, certaines des clauses dans ce
contrat sont fournies ci-dessous en français. 

EXONÉRATION DE GARANTIE. 
a)	Le logiciel visé par une licence est offert « tel quel
». Toute utilisation de ce logiciel est à votre seule risque et péril. Microsoft
n’accorde aucune autre garantie expresse. Vous pouvez bénéficier de droits
additionnels en vertu du droit local sur la protection des consommateurs, que ce
contrat ne peut modifier. La ou elles sont permises par le droit locale, les
garanties implicites de qualité marchande, d’adéquation à un usage particulier
et d’absence de contrefaçon sont exclues. 
b)	CLAUSE D’EXCLUSION DE RESPONSABILITÉ RELATIVE À L’UTILISATION À HAUT RISQUE. 
AVERTISSEMENT: LE LOGICIEL N’EST PAS CONÇU OU DESTINÉ À ÊTRE UTILISÉ LORSQU’UNE 
DÉFAILLANCE OU UN DÉFAUT DE QUELQUE NATURE QUE CE SOIT POURRAIT ENTRAÎNER LA 
MORT OU DES BLESSURES CORPORELLES GRAVES, OU DES DOMMAGES PHYSIQUES OU 
ENVIRONNEMENTAUX (« Utilisation à haut risque »). Par conséquent, vous devez concevoir et mettre en 
œuvre votre équipement et votre logiciel de manière à ce que, en cas d’interruption, de défaut, d’erreur 
ou de toute autre défaillance du logiciel, la sécurité des personnes, des biens et de l’environnement ne 
soit pas réduite en dessous d’un niveau raisonnable, approprié et légal, que ce soit en général ou pour 
un secteur spécifique. Votre utilisation à haut risque du logiciel est à vos propres risques.

LIMITATION DES DOMMAGES-INTÉRÊTS ET EXCLUSION DE RESPONSABILITÉ POUR LES
DOMMAGES. Vous pouvez obtenir de Microsoft et de ses fournisseurs une
indemnisation en cas de dommages directs uniquement à hauteur de 5,00 $ US. Vous
ne pouvez prétendre à aucune indemnisation pour les autres dommages, y compris
les dommages spéciaux, indirects ou accessoires et pertes de bénéfices. 

Cette limitation concerne: 

•tout ce qui est relié au logiciel, aux services ou au contenu (y compris le
code) figurant sur des sites Internet tiers ou dans des programmes tiers; et 

•les réclamations au titre de violation de contrat ou de garantie, ou au titre
de responsabilité stricte, de négligence ou d’une autre faute dans la limite
autorisée par la loi en vigueur. 

Elle s’applique également, même si Microsoft connaissait ou devrait connaître
l’éventualité d’un tel dommage. Si votre pays n’autorise pas l’exclusion ou la
limitation de responsabilité pour les dommages indirects, accessoires ou de
quelque nature que ce soit, il se peut que la limitation ou l’exclusion
ci-dessus ne s’appliquera pas à votre égard. 

EFFET JURIDIQUE. Le présent contrat décrit certains droits juridiques. Vous
pourriez avoir d’autres droits prévus par les lois de votre pays. Le présent
contrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous confèrent les lois de votre pays si
celles-ci ne le permettent pas.
